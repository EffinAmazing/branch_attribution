# branch_attribution

This block will work in a similar way to the Segment Web Attribution block, but instead of using default Segment `user_id` and `anonymous_id` it will use the Branch Cross-platform ID (`cp_id`). 

The current version is not complete or ready for production. The `anonymous_id` has been replaced with the `cp_id` in most places and the views have been adjusted to look across Web, iOS, and Android sources, but more work is needed to finalize this block.
